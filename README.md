# atomsmasher

Atom Smasher is my personal collection of number-crunching scripts for EVE Online industry tasks.  It mainly handles build recipes, stockpile management, and profitability reports.

Most of its features are now ESI-integrated, including fetching inventory and checking market prices.

Actions are done using scripts, Lua configs, and tab-separated text files, so there is a significant learning curve and some jankiness, but once set up, this is one of the most powerful tools available.

If you need support, ask questions in gs_isk on GSF Jabber or in the Atom Smasher thread on the GSF forums.  Support will not be given to non-allied players.

If you want to donate ISK or whatever then send it to Successful Businessman.
