Revision 1-8:
- Tears in rain

Revision 9:
- Fixed shopping list generator outputting garbage or crashing when on-hand inventory of an item exceeded the number required.
- Reorganized the directories: All table files that are supposed to be user-editable are now in "userdata" and all outputs now wind up in "outputs" which should make future releases less of a clusterfuck.
- Now generates an "invention.csv" table with a ton of data on every invention/decryptor combo attempt.
- Now supports facility material cost reduction.  Change "structureMatRoleBonus" in config.lua to the structure's manufacturing role bonus, and edit its category bonuses in "facility_reductions.dat."
- There's also a new config option named "reportFacilityBonuses" which factors the material reductions into the invention report costs, but usually this isn't a terrific idea because the material reductions and SCI/tax tend to offset each other, but the report doesn't account for SCI/tax, so it will be optimistic.
- Shopping list generator build objectives now have a "runsPerBlueprint" column.  The shopping list generator will always attempt to build a multiple of the blueprint maximum though.  For blueprints with unlimited runs (i.e. T1 shit) set the runs per blueprint to zero.

Revision 10:
- Fixed price downloader crash from unnamed items being on the market since the recent patch. :ccp:
- Fixed crash when an intermediate isn't on the market at all.
- Shopping list generator now lists the actual number of items built when it asks you to build something instead of how many it needs.  This mostly affects RAMs, which it will now always list in multiples of 100.

Revision 11:
- Shopping list generator now supports reactions, including alchemy.  It can build your T2 shit straight from moonerals if you want.
- Shopping list generator now produces a list of leftovers and recovered materials at the end
To change whether it prefers alchemy or normal reaction for an item, change the corresponding entry in the "alchemy" table in config.lua
To disable reactions entirely, set the "enableReactions" config value to false.  To make it only react specific things, edit items_intermediates.dat as usual.
Remember to set the "scrapmetalReprocessingEfficiency" and "structureReactionMatReduction" values.
And yes, you CAN tell it to build only reactions in the build objectives but you still need to fill in the ME and runs-per-blueprint columns so the CSV parser doesn't barf, and it will currently ignore them.

Revision 12:
- Aborted.

Revision 13:
- Fixed the bad intermediate pricing bug.
- New config option "showExpenditures" outputs some extra columns in the shopping list showing how many of the item will actually be consumed, minus how many are left over or recovered, making it easier to appraise expenses when you're building from raws or using alchemy.

Revision 14:
- Now supports generating reaction reports.  The reaction report contains two tables: reactions_alchemy.csv details cost savings per hour for alchemizing various reactions.  reactions_complex.csv details full-chain reactions in terms of profitability and outputs two scenarios: Cheapest inputs, and highest profit per slot-hour.  It will also tell you if an input should always be alchemized (unlikely) or if it's slower.
- Price level computation now supports reactions.  This will always use alchemy settings in config.
intermediates.csv is now put in "outputs", where it should be.
- compute_price_levels now generates warnings if your dependencies are out of order.  Intermediate chains should always be sorted so that inputs are above any item that consumes it.

Revision 15:
- Fixed reaction times being too long.  Reaction reports are probably still buggy.  Keep in mind that profit-per-slot-hour still doesn't account for time reduction or skills (because it applies to all reactions, so I don't care.)

Revision 16:
- Early ESI support

Right now the only thing ESI support is used for is slurping your industry jobs and assets directly into the on-hand inventory file, but I should get it to support facility costs semi-soon too, and then maybe some better market metrics (including the old outlier filter, hopefully).

The asset collator uses a system list in the config to figure out what systems it cares about, so you don't have to worry about it counting the stack of carbides that you're trying to sell in Jita or 1DQ if your build system is somewhere else.  If you're building in the same system that you sell out of, you're out of luck for now.

There are a LOT of caveats with doing this:

The error detection on token refreshes is currently awful, partly because the errors I'm getting back from CCP are useless.  There's no way to tell if an error is happening because of some temporary glitch or because the token was permanently revoked, and I may also change the scopes that Atom Smasher can request at any time, which will nuke all of your tokens.  If you're getting errors when it tries to re-auth, try running "esi_purge_auths.bat" and re-authorizing everything.

Corporation assets and jobs are NOT currently supported.  My alt corp is on ice, so I'll have to install a blueprint in highsec or something to work on it unless someone wants to be a guinea pig.

ULTRA EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: The asset list from the API seems to have a really long cache time, possibly an hour.  It's much longer than the industry job API, which can cause it to do things like include industry products AND their inputs in your inventory list at the same time.  It's highly recommended that you check the on-hand inventory and make sure it reflects your most recent inventory changes!

Collation will only treat in-progress alchemy reactions as producing the unrefined product.  Aside from not counting the recycled moonerals (which is intentional), this can get you burned if you disable alchemy for a reaction in config before the build is finished, in which case the shopping list generator will not count the intermediates that you'd get from refining the alchemy products, because it won't add the unrefined products as inputs.
 
Citadel location resolution uses the first character that it sees an asset on.  If you authorize an alt that is no longer blue, but has shit in GSF stations, then it may cause the location resolver to give up and record the citadel as an unknown location, even if you have characters that can see it.  Don't register non-blue alts and you won't have this problem, you filthy spy.


Revision 17:
- Asset collating now supports scanning corporation assets and industry jobs.  You need to have a character authorized with the Director role to scan assets, and Factory Manager role for industry jobs.  It will only count items in corp hangars and deliveries.
- Added config option "showRecipeBuildTimes" which adds a build time column to shopping lists so you can see where your bottlenecks are and plan your slot usage accordingly.
- Fixed token refreshes failing if the token contained certain characters.
- Fixed Wolf being in the intermediates file by default (which also made it have the wrong market price).

Revision 18:
- Fixed a bug where inventory collation was only counting one active reaction job's outputs.

Revision 19:
- Fixed a bug where the asset scanner would fail to parse assets from structures owned by a corporation that you have director roles in.

Revision 20:
- Now supports Tech III.  Have fun building your weird wormhole shit.  (This feature is in beta so please report any bugs.)
- Improved documentation a bit.
- The default config file no longer has any alchemy reactions enabled.

Revision 21:
- Now accounts for job install fees.  To update the install fee data, download prices again.  For reactions and manufacturing, you need to set up the build systems in "userdata/build_systems.dat".  The "Default" category is used for anything you don't set, and there are only 4 reaction categories anyway, so copy them from your industry tab.  For invention, you need to set the invention system in config.lua.  The install fees are slightly inaccurate because ESI only reports the system index to 2 decimal places.

Revision 22:
- Fixed some crashes.
- Fixed alchemy install fees not being calculated correctly.
- Reaction report now accounts for install fees.
- Changed the default reaction material reduction bonus from 2.6 to 2.64 (the correct value for a T2 rigged Tatara in nullsec)

Revision 23:
- Fixed profit/unit summary value displaying the wrong value for multiple-quantity blueprints (like ammo).
- Fixed crash when a T3 relic's price is unavailable.
- Split "enableReactions" config option into "enableReactionsInReport" and "enableReactionsInShoppingLists".  This mainly exists so that you can disable the first option to gauge the added value of manufacturing the T2 items without it baking in profitability from the reactions, but still provide a complete list when generating a shopping list.

Revision 24:
- Fixed a crash when running the shopping list generator without ever generating a report.
- Fixed a crash when a category reduction is missing.  This now generates a warning instead.
- Updated "Cynosural Field" category to "Cynosural Field Generator" in to match new SDE.
- Fixed a crash when a finished item is sold out in Jita.

Revision 25 beta 1:
- Reaction report now shows input volume so you can calculate import fees on stupid bulky wormhole gas.
- Shopping list generator now supports presets!  To use a preset, edit userdata/build_objective_presets.csv.  If you add an item to the build objectives sheet and it doesn't exist, the shopping list generator will check to see if any rows exist in build_objective_presets with that preset name in the "preset" column, and if so, add those rows to your build list.  You can also enter "defer" as the ME or runs per blueprint value of a preset row: Doing that will require that the blueprint properties already exist on the build objective sheet (i.e. by having a zero-quantity row), otherwise the shopping list generator will throw an error.  You can use this to prevent mistakes when the blueprint properties are inconsistent (i.e. because of decryptors).
- Market data download now uses ESI instead of a third-party aggregator, and the outlier filter is back!  This should give more accurate pricing information.
- Added changelog

Revision 25 beta 2:
- Fixed bugs with pretty much everything added in beta 1.

Revision 25 beta 3:
- SDE Parser now ignores unpublished blueprints.  This should in help with problems where it thinks certain meta and faction modules are buildable when they aren't.
- Moved several price calculation functions to different scripts, which should make price fetches slightly faster.
- Fixed several things not working in a fresh install.
- Removed the AggregateDownloader tool.

Revision 26:
- Added items_autobuy.dat to userdata, which allows you to specify items that should be purchased instead of built if they are available below build cost when making shopping lists.  Using the auto-buy file requires running the main report to generate items_intermediates.csv, since that contains the buy vs. build information.

Revision 27 beta 1:
- Added support for multiple markets and citadel markets

Revision 27 beta 2:
- Fixed compatibility issue with June 25 2019 "Invasion" SDE

Revision 27 beta 3:
- Fixed a problem with the default config citadel markets

Revision 28:
- Fixed compatibility issue with September 11 2019 "Grrrgoons No Cynoes" SDE

Revision 29:
- Now outputs "High per manufacturing job" results in invention report.
- Fixed formatting of "Invention cost" and "Build cost" columns.
- Fixes a crash when an input item is completely sold out in all checked markets.

Revision 30:
- Fixed compatibility issue with new SDE

Revision 31:
- Fixed compatibility issue with new SDE that was causing industry outputs to not be collated.
